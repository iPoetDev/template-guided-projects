# Create a Voice Assistant with OpenAI's GPT-3 and IBM Watson

> Local variant of source git and SkillsNetwork (and CognitiveClasses CDE Labs hosting).

## Introduction

> This repos is a mirror of a **<ins>guided project</ins>** on creating a voice assistant using OpenAI and IBM Watson Speech Libraries for Embed. 
>> The guided project takes you through building a virtual assistant that can take voice input, convert it to text using speech-to-text technology, send the text to OpenAI's GPT-3 model, receive a response, convert it to speech using text-to-speech technology and finally play it back to the user. <br><br>
>> The voice assistant will have a responsive front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a reliable back-end using Flask. <br><br>

### Goal

1.  To build a deep understanding of voice assistants and the skills to create your own AI-powered assistant that can communicate through voice input and output.
2.  To develop a strong foundation in web development using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a finished full stack application!

### Topics

- OpenAI
- IBM Watson speech libraries for embed
- Voice assistants
- Python (Flask)
- HTML - CSS - Javascript

## Objectives

- Explain the basics of voice assistants and their various applications
- Set up a development environment for building an assistant using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- Implement speech-to-text functionality to allow the assistant to understand voice input from users
- Integrate the assistant with OpenAI's GPT-3 model to give it a high level of intelligence and the ability to understand and respond to user requests
- Implement text-to-speech functionality to allow the assistant to communicate with users through voice output
- Combine all the above components to create a functional assistant that can take voice input and provide a spoken response
- (Optional) Deploy the assistant to a web server for use by a wider audience
